## 2028 Athens Anacondas 

The Athens Anacondas waltz in to Dealth Valley and pulled off an all time upset over #2 Clemson in week 0. Giving up 21 team overall points to the fearsome Tigers. Coach Taylor and the Anacondas are brewing something really special in Athens.

### Inside Scoop
Cunning and Conniving of Coach Taylor as detailed in overheard backdoor talks:
"I need to tamper with this guy to get him in the portal. With leadership like that, the Anacondas would never lose a game again."
The player in reference? George Washington of Ohio University.

### Anacondas Update

Due to the collapse of the Big 12, the Anacondas have made the playoffs, and not as the 12 seed (11!). The early season win against Clemson has paid dividends, perhaps canceling out the head scratching loss to Utah State in Week 4. Devastatingly, Athens transfer Clayton Taylor has won the Heisman for the Tennessee Vols after betraying the Condas.

### Anacondas Update
This years playoff was likely the most entertaining set of games in modern college football history. With only 3 games the entire posteason being settled before the final drive.

Fan favorite Athens went to Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh and stunned the Panthers with a goal line touchdown with mere seconds left on the clock. The Panthers made it interesting completing a Hail Mary on the final play, however time peetered away when the Panthers could not get to the line of scrimmage fast enough to spike the ball for a potential walk off field goal.

Fresh off one of, arguably, the greatest CFP upsets ever, the Anacondas ran out of steam, letting the whole nation down. They were drubbed by the Auburn Tigers in the Sugar Bowl. The game was over before halftime. Injuries to the Anacondas caught up to them. Their season opening QB, RB, RB2, TE, TE2, LT, RT, RT2, Left Edge, and DT all missing the playoffs with some form of ailment, from career ending ACL tears to shoulder bruises. (*Eye roll).* The fact that the Anacondas scored on Auburn at all, with their B-team is a true testament of the geinus of Coach Taylor.

The Anacondas return next year with their eyes set on again winning the Sun Belt Conference. They bring in three 4-star talents to bolster the offense in this edition of the recruiting cycle. It remains to be seen if this past year was a flash in the pan or the beginning of Sun Belt supremacy. Rumblings of another round of conference realignment reverberate as the ACC and zombie Pac-12 look to finish media deals. Many top experts and fans will have their eyes on the Athens Anacondas for the next few years.

### Note Around the Nation
- Dan Lanning and Oklahoma finally win a national title, both of them getting the monkey off their back.

- All four teams of the semifinals were SEC teams in 2028.

- Traitor Clayton Taylor chose to forgo his Senior year, being drafted in the first round. We can safely assume, after a Heisman campaign, he goes number one overall. Likely to a crappy team too. What a fool.

### Inside Scoop
Coach Taylor got his wish, as George Washington did in fact enter the transfer portal, but immediately narrowed down to 8 teams, leaving Athens below the current line. Coach Taylor has expressed devastation.

## 2029 Athens Anacondas

In 2029, the CFP committee, ESPN, and what is left of the NCAA made an agreement that ESPN would have the rights to force schedule 4 NCAA football teams schedules for the first week. Nullifying any other standing agreements for games for that week. The only caveat is that the forced change must result in a playoff rematch from the year before. In the first rendition of CFPR (College Football Playoff Revenge). ESPN somewhat controversially chose to force a Pittsburgh versus underdog Athens rematch. Since Athens won in 2028, they were allowed to host as reward.

Pitt came into the game ranked 7th in the nation, boasting a top 10 recruiting class in 2028 and looking to exact revenge on Athens for the embarassment of losing in the playoffs in an upset to a Sun Belt team, at home no less. 

The Anacondas, unranked and breaking in a new quarterback since Jaylen Dugger had graduated the year before, were looking at the game as a learning opportunity. Coach Taylor made some peculiar comments before the game that sounded to some reporters as waving the white flag. The Anacondas had held a hotly contested camp battle between 3-star Redshirt sophomore Ngawbuo and highest ever recruit to the Athens, the newly touted 4-star true freshman Max Clemens out of Paramus, New Jersey. Ngawbuo, a dual threat quarterback with more dynamism and flash than Clemens- more of a prototypical pocket passer- won the job, but it seemed as though the dust had yet to truly settle. 

### Anacondas Update

After a rough couple of possessions for Ngawbuo, a missed blitz pickup resulted in a free rusher to his blindside. The hit cracked his collarbone, putting him out for eight weeks. It seemed the decision was already made for Coach Taylor. Against his better judgment, the true freshman would then lead the Anacondas for the bulk of the season. Luckily for Athens, Max was a star. He carved Pitt to the tune of 355 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions in a thorough handling of the Panthers. Athens prevailed against Pitt, cementing a future mini-rivalry. This formidable Pitt were no pushovers either, as they would go on to make the playoffs, winning the ACC in the process. 

### Anacondas Update
After a sound loss at Rice-Eccles in the rain to a mediocre Utah squad in Week 2, Max and the Anacondas tore through the Sun Belt conference, going 7-1 with a lone loss to South Alabama in the worst game of Max's career, throwing 4 picks in the first half. Athens mounted a furious second half comeback that just fell short of digging them out of their 30 point halftime hole. 

Excepting the loss to Utah and USA (not the country), Athens looked strong. It was no surprise that they took down a feisty Lousiana Lafayette for a second time in a row to win the Sun Belt title. Due to the key losses by Weber State in the MWC championship game, and a loss by Tulane in the Pac-12 title game, Athens snuck in as the 12-seed and a date with Clemson in the playoff.

### Anacondas Update
Coach Sweeney and quarterback Tyrell Vinson were quite loud in the lead up to the playoff game, questioning the Anacondas autobid in place of 13th ranked Louisville, a fellow ACC member. If you can recall, Athens landed one of the greatest upsets ever last year by beating Clemson in Death Valley. But it seemed the bragging was warranted on Clemson's part, as they handled the Anacondas in a game that was not as close as the score would indicate. All in all, another suprising and successful season for Coach Taylor and the Anacondas. 

### Anacondas Update

In the recruiting front, Coach Taylor quietly assembled a top 25 recruiting class, headlined by the first 5-star in school history, WR Dom Peters out of Indianapolis, Indiana. The Anacondas faced stiff opposition from Indiana and Purdue, schools not known for elite CFB recruiting, for the prized recruit, but in the end the prestige, charisma, and sway of Coach Taylor won Dom over. Described as an elusive route runner, all eyes will be on Dom if he can deliver on the hype and push Athens to new heights. 

### Conference Realignment

And push he must, as Athens has been the central piece in the first of presumably many dominoes to fall in conference realignment. In a move that shocked no one, several conferences have dropped some of their chronically underperforming members in exchange for more up and coming universities. The single largest domino this year is the ascension of Athens from the Sun Belt, the least prestigious conference in the FBS, to the ACC, arguably the highest rated conference.

Accompanying this shakeup is the casting out of Boston College, following a putrid 2-9 season, to the American Conference to make room for Athens in the ACC. Other notable moves include the ascension of North Texas to the Pac-12 following the Heisman campaign and subsequent number 1 overall draft pick of their quarterback Treston McMillan. The Pac-12 removed Utah State to make room for UNT, following 4 straight disappointing years of bowl ineligibility from the Aggies. The aforementioned Lousiana Lafayette Ragin Cajuns also moved from the Sun Belt to the American, along with perennially overachieving Toledo from the MAC. The American was forced to remove Jax State and Liberty in subsequent moves. It seems, after several recent rulings by the Supreme Court, that conferences may become more akin to promotion and relegation, rather than geography and alliance. Time will tell. 

Wrapping things up in Athens, Coach Taylor is excited to get to work. He has never had the resources and prestige of a major conference backing his recruiting efforts. Time will tell if Athens can hang with the big boys, but this humble reporter is fascinated to see how the budding rivalries with Pitt, Clemson, and to a lesser degree, Georgia Tech unfold for the Anacondas in their new home in the ACC.

## 2030 Athens Anacondas

What a year it was for Coach Taylor and the Anacondas. Following up the greatest recruiting class in school history and an invitation to the ACC, hopes were high in Athens. You could feel that this season had the chance to be something truly special. And special it was. 

With the ascension of true freshman QB Max Clemens to the top tier of the college game, the nation (and the AP) took notice of Athens and gave them their due respect, clocking in at #7 in the opening poll. High praise for a team playing their first season at the Power 4 level. 

### Anacondas Update
And it all was warranted. Coach Taylor and the Anacondas, for the first time in school history, won the Battle 4 Athens, dispatching the Bulldogs handily. This was only a harbinger of what was to come. 

### Anacondas Update
They then ran through the ACC, achieving a 7-1 conference record (with several scares along the way) with the lone blemish being a defeat at the hands of their now rival Clemson Tigers, in a rainy, cold night at Death Valley. The Anacondas also held the #1 ranking for the first time in school history, possessing that ranking for 2 weeks before their dethroning at the hands of Clemson in a game that featured the #1 and #2 teams in all the land. 

Incredibly, due to the conference's insistence on divisions, this loss was enough to preclude the Anacondas from the ACC title game. Clemson also only had a single conference loss, and with the head to head tiebreaker over the Anacondas in the South Division, Clemson punched their ticket to the ACC title game where they were embarrassed by the newly minted #1 Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 

### Anacondas Update
But not to worry, the Anacondas were not left out of the dance, clocking in as the #5 seed in all the land. Some may say that is the most advantageous seed, as you receive a home playoff game, ostensibly against a weaker team. A win at home can and has been used as a springboard for many deep CFP runs. What made it all the sweeter was this was a matchup with old Sun Belt rivals Louisiana Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns. They visited "The Jungle" in Athens just as old times. Despite the theatrics and the media firestorm in the lead up to a CFP rivalry game, Athens dispatched the Cajuns handily in a a 52-10 drubbing. 

The next round was just as calm, as the Anacondas knocked out #4 Nebraska in a 38-24 game that was not as close as the score would suggest. This set the team up for an ACC clash in the semifinal with the aforementioned #1 Notre Dame. In a high scoring affair, Max Clemons and the anacondas were able to make just a few more plays than the fighting Irish, downing them 49-42. RS senior Zach Nash, the forgotten first 4 star recruit in school history, poured in 3 TDs and 185 yards in the night of his life. 

<img src="/AnacondasPics/Hurdle.png" alt="Hurdle" class= "big" />

### Anacondas Update

This was all the set up to the big one. The CFP national championship featured the #5 Athens Anacondas versus the #2 Penn St. Nittany Lions. These teams had no history, other than recruiting battles. They had never played each other before, with an all time record at a clean 0-0. 

If you're a fan of punting and old school defense (and who isn't?), then this was the game for you. Neither team could get any traction on the ground nor the air, nor anywhere in between. The halftime score was a deadlocked 7-7 score, with each team's points coming from a pick-six. The second half brought much of the same, but offensive adjustments at halftime yielded some fruit. With just 5 minutes left, Penn State scored a go ahead TD, leaving the Anacondas in put up or shut up mode. Down 6 with 5 minmutes and all 3 timeouts, the goal for Max Clemons was simple: drive the field, eat the clock, and score with only seconds remaining.

Max and the Anacondas met half of those goals (even though there were three of them). Scoring with a minute and a half left on the clock, the Anacondas went up by one. Max had done all he could do, it was up to the nations number 1 ranked defense to hold down the fort and deliver a national championship for the former cupcake in Athens. 

But hold they did not. Allowing QB Riley Nelson (yes that was actually his name) and the Penn State offense to awaken from a 3.5 quarter slumber as they marched down the field, scoring the game winning touchdown with only seconds remaining. Coach Franklin stunningly outmaneuvered Coach Taylor to land Penn State their fifth national championship, and first since 1986. 

Despite the bitter disappointment in how the season ended, it can't be forgotten how much this team accomplished in just their first year at the Power 4 level. A national championship loss does not a failed season make. The Anacondas are well well ahead of schedule, and it's just a matter of time before they break through. 

### Athens Insider
Coach Taylor has got a decent stable of running backs, but nothing special. It seems Athens is cursed because if a running back receives more than 100 carries in a season, they won't be available for the playoff. Wear and tear is cool, but poorly balanced in this world of football.

### Anacondas Update
Next season is shaping up to be another assault on the title. QB Max Clemons will reprise his role as the leader of the team for likely his final time, as at the conclusion of the 2031 season he will be draft eligible and almost certainly will enter. Athens landed two 5-stars in this cycle, along with 20+ 4-stars, good for the 9th ranked recruiting class this cycle. With key acquisitions in the portal at WR to supplement the arrival of Dom Peter's (who redshirted this year), the Anacondas offense looks scary for 2031. Hopefully this time around Coach Taylor will play for the kill.

## 2031 Athens Anacondas
The bigger they are, the harder they fall. This cliche is the only way to describe the letdown for the 2031 Athens Anacondas. 

The harbinger of what was to come was the surprising exit of phenom Max Clemens. Max entered the transfer portal citing the opportunity to “build his brand”. Those in the know are saying that Clemson offered him the entire bag to jump ship to the Tigers. Athens had no chance to match it.

### Anacondas Update
  Enter Redshirt Freshman George Keiaho. George was a high 4-star out of Atlanta, GA. Heralded as a dual threat QB, he was known to be a moldable ball of clay with all the physical gifts in the world, just lacking technique. Coach Taylor and the Anacondas planned for that clay to stay in the kiln for another year, but they were forced to pull him out earlier than they wanted, and this showed itself on the field. 

  ### Anacondas Update
  Athens suffered their worst season since Coach Taylor took the helm. Worse than the winning percentage in the dark days of Sun Belt futility. The Anacondas finished at 6-6, going 4-4 in ACC play, unsurprisingly missing out on the college football playoff. There were many close games and learning opportunities sprinkled throughout the season, yet Keiaho was not able to deliver. Athens ranked in the top 10 in team defense, but that was not enough to overcome one of the nations worst passing attacks. Playing in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl the year after losing a heartbreaker in the national championship, evoked TCU levels of whiplash.

### Anacondas Update
Despite the lack of success in the season, Coach Taylor and the recruiting department got after it this offseason, bringing in a top 5 class nationally, featuring four 5-star recruits. The Anacondas also went crazy in the transfer portal, bringing a likely first round draft pick in corner Shakir Mady, several interior offensive lineman, and a stud tight end from rival Troy.

### Anacondas Update
He hasn’t been mentioned yet as this publication tends to focus on QB, but senior WR Jimmy Dwumfour has concluded his storied career as a campus legend at Athens. Surpassing the goat Albert Wilson for the lead in career receptions, yards, and receiving touchdowns. Jimmy was unsurprisingly a first round pick, after running a 4.29 at 6’4” and 230 pounds. Though his route tree is somewhat limited for NFL standards, somebody was bound to take a chance on such elite athletic traits. 

A shorter update this year, but I suppose that’s what happens when you’re sad.

## 2032 Athens Anacondas

We are so back. Mostly. It was definitely better than last year. The bar was buried, but Athens still cleared it. 

### Anacondas Update

Following the embarrassment of 2031, Coach Taylor and the Anacondas were pissed. The defensive firepower being wasted on a toothless offense was a tragedy for the newly minted P4 member. Consequently, DC Luke Fickell, former Cincinnati and Wisconsin HC, left for the greener pastures of Miami of Ohio to be their new HC. Additionally, Athens faced its largest transfer portal exodus of Coach Taylor’s tenure, losing 12 players, some higher impact than others, to the churn. Nobody would say it out loud, but it was on the minds of many in the program that the lack of development by uber athletic but technically deficient quarterback George Keiaho was to blame for the lost season. 

George absolutely took this unspoken slight to heart and worked his ever living tail off in the offseason. From the first gimme game against FCS West, to the ACC showdown with Clemson, anybody with eyeballs could see this was a different player. Making second, third, and fourth reads. Rifling passes through tight windows, and taking shots far down the field. George was hungry to prove the doubters wrong. 

### Anacondas Update

Athens took it a bit slower in the non-conference this season, hoping to perhaps inflate their win total a little bit and also ease George into the season. Taking their only loss in a not-too-surprising beatdown from the Bulldogs in the Battle for Athens, the outlook for this team headed into the ACC the race was still very murky. 

Athens also drew an absolutely brutal ACC schedule this year. The usual suspects of Miami and Clemson were obviously ranked in top 10, but conference also-rans Pitt and Florida State were receiving votes to begin the season. That was not something that Athens was doing. The Anacondas also drew Louisville from the other division, a bona fide top 15 team themselves. But the silver lining of a brutal schedule is respect from the CFP committee when selection day rolls around. 

Athens stunned with a 8-0 ACC record, with only one game (Clemson) being competitive entering the 4th quarter. Athens handily dispatched Louisville for a second time in the ACC title game 40-16. Claiming their first ACC title, and first conference title since 2029 in the Sun Belt, Athens was feeling good entering the selection show. It was no surprise that Athens, boasting their only loss being as previously mentioned to #4 UGA, brandishing a strength of record that dwarfed every other team in the nation, was awarded the number 1 overall seed.

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/Hurdle 2.png" alt="Hurdle 2" class= "med" />

### Anacondas Update

Obviously, the progression of George Keiaho was exponential. George was invited to New York for the Hesiman ceremony. He ultimately did not win, but his even being in the conversation was unthinkable a year ago. The often missed key to George's sucess was the breakout of Redshirt Junior Dom Peters.

 Dom, as you venomous Anaconda fans recall, was the first ever 5-star recruit to Athens. He has been a consummate professional his entire career. He embraced the redshirt his freshman year. He accepted the coaching decision to not get many snaps as a RS freshman. But to this authors view, his single most telling decision was to stay with the team after Athens short circuited his progression by loading up on senior transfer receivers his RS Sophomore year. Despite still not seeing the field for the first 3 years as the first 5-star in school history, Dom remained on the team, waiting his turn. So when he was unleashed on the nation, he was well polished and ready to go. His usage was not extremely high, as Coach Taylor leaned on his RB depth for most of the season to protect Keiaho, but he was efficient. 39 catches for 556 yards and 9 touchdowns. We will see if he bolts for the NFL or runs it back for another year. 

### Anacondas Update

After enjoying the always wild first round of the playoffs from home, the team that emerged to challenge the Anacondas was none other than the Michigan Wolverines. Michigan dispatched the 9th seeded Arizona State Sun Devils, setting up a showdown with Athens in the Orange Bowl. But unfortunately for them, Coach Taylor absolutely cooks in the Orange Bowl, boasting a now 3-0 record in only blowout affiars. And dinner was served. Athens eliminated the Wolverines in a game that was not as close as the score might indicate. This set up, once again, a Rivalry game in the CFP with the Battle for Athens. 

### Anacondas Update

That’s right, the only team that beat Athens this year was waiting for them once again in the semifinals. The lead up to the always exciting CFP rivalry game, was insane. Completely unprecedented. The mayor of Athens had to institute a city wide curfew for the entire week as there were so many fights breaking out between fans of the Condas and Dawgs. For gameday, a first in national history, the governor of Georgia instituted Marshall Law to activate the national guard as a resource to facilitate the game, as naturally this game was at the Sugar Bowl, taking place in Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. 

But much ado about nothing! Athens thrashed the Dawgs in a 33-7 beatdown that only featured a whimpering touchdown in garbage time by UGA. The Anacondas had done it again! One year after a .500 record, Coach Taylor had lead the boys back to the national title game. Who was there to meet them? None other than the UCLA Bruins.

### Anacondas Update - of UCLA

The Bruins, resurrected by the unlikeliest of sources, Coach Lincoln Riley, had been rebuilding for several years. This team was a surprise, an anomaly. They were supposed to be a year away from being a year away, but after a very impressive 6-2 finish, it wasn’t quite enough. They missed out on a chance at the B1G title game. After the dust settled on conference championship weekend, with no unexpected results, UCLA was able to sneak into the field as the 11-seed. Likely powered by their emphatic victory over rival USC earlier in the year. Still, they were a controversial inclusion, as they suffered one of the worst losses by a playoff team in a home game against the lowly Northwestern Wildcats. 

Their playoff run was impressive. First they downed the Cinderella’s of yesteryear in Colorado State, who repeated their CFP appearance out of the Pac-12. They then snuck past the SEC runner up Mizzou. Finally, UCLA handed the undefeated Oklahoma State Cowboys their first and only lost of the season in a legendary matchup that ended as UCLA went for 2 and the win after completion of a 2-minute drill touchdown drive. The foes were unfamiliar but they were both very hungry. 

### Anacondas Update

The score at half was a bizarre 17-19. Athens had notched a safety in the final seconds of the half after a beautiful 1-yard line coffin corner punt by Athens Punter Ben Maghoologan. The score at the end of the third was 24-26. The final quarter was shaping up to be one for the ages. But, to the horror of all watching, except perhaps Bruins fans, the referees inserted themselves center stage. Athens lost three, count em, three long touchdown bombs to *controversial* holding calls in favor of UCLA. The deflation and insane momentum swings accompanying each call were too much for the Anacondas to bear. They were outscored 14-0 in the final quarter as UCLA completed their own Cinderella run, claiming a title for the first time since 1954. Coach Lincoln Riley became the 4th coach to win national titles at 2 different schools, following in the steps of coaching legends Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Kirby Smart. 

*Writers note: What kind of sick freak wins nattys with 2 different bitter rivals? Lincoln is built different.*

It was an all too familiar nightmare for Coach Taylor and the Anacondas. Once again to reach the top of the mountain, only to tumble back down before planting a flag. Coach Riley’s joy was Coach Taylor’s bile. Nobody could blame him as he moved like a corpse walking, back to the tunnel away from the blue and yellow confetti. 

### Anacondas Update

The Anacondas will be back. They once again boast a top 5 national recruiting class with four 5-star prospects. Despite losing some defensive talent to the NFL draft, Athens is locked and loaded for 2033.


### Conference Realignment 2033

So it has come down to this. College football will never be the same. In one of the most consequential moves in the history of the sport, the B1G has removed their mask and cast out the academic stalwart university’s in a bid to consolidate revenue amongst the 12 highest performing schools. Emboldened by the supreme courts decision back in 2029, the B1G pulled the trigger, ousting Rutgers, Northwestern, Illinois, Maryland, Purdue, and even Iowa. This decision caused a domino effect throughout the rest of the nation. 

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/ConfBigTen.jpeg" alt="Big10 Conference" class= "med" />


In order for the rest of the top tier teams to now keep up with revenue that the lean new B1G teams would be generating, they followed suit by cutting out their underachieving conference members to leave more of the revenue pie available to their top 12 teams. The ACC and the SEC followed this model, but not the Big 12. More on them in a bit. 

The bloodshed in the SEC was unparalleled. Obviously Vanderbilt was removed. They were very nonchalant about this coupe, having been planning for this eventuality for years. The discourse amongst the remaining SEC members on the other 3 teams to be removed was terse. Much of the talk was centered around performance, ostensibly an objective metric. By this case Auburn, Arkansas, Mississippi State, and the aforementioned Vanderbilt. But nothing is ever that easy. The SEC classics threatened to blow the entire conference apart if Auburn was removed, with Alabama being the most ferocious defendant of the Tigers. Ole Miss was the great defendant of Misst St. In defense of Arkansas was their old Big 8 brethren in Mizzou, Texas, and Oklahoma. It was telling that the greatest rivals of the SEC teams on the chopping block were their strongest proponents for inclusion. But in the end, nobody came to the defense of Kentucky or South Carolina, with Ole Miss being overpowered by the classics, losing Mississipi State in the process. It was a bitter, and heated discussion, that will likely preclude any further changes to the SEC structure for a generation, unless the federal government intervenes again. When the dust finally settled, the SEC was consolidated into the following:

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/ConfSEC.jpeg" alt="SEC Conference" class= "med" />


Things in the ACC were far more civil. The top teams in the ACC, spearheaded by Clemson and Florida State called for consolidation to match the B1G and the SEC. The other top ACC teams agreed with heavy hearts. It was obvious to all that Wake Forest was done. It was less obvious, but the Virginia schools were also toast. Where the peculiar decision was made was to steal Tulane from the Pac-12 to replace Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech was furious with this decision, and argued for inclusion on the basis of history and tradition, but the argument fell on deaf ears, as objectively Tulane was a far better option for the ACC moving forward.  

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/ConfACC.jpeg" alt="ACC Conference" class= "med" />


The dear reader may ask, “What happened to the fallen power teams?” and “What happened to the Big 12?” Let’s address the Big 12 first. When the newly anointed P3 zigged, the Big 12 zagged. Recognizing that there was no obvious overachievers from a perennially balanced conference, there was no hierarchy for the Big 12 to consolidate around. No teams were chronically underperforming over the years, so ousting was not the conclusion made by the Big 12, but rather expansion.

 One might think that they would snatch up the falling power teams, but rather they stole the over-performing Pac-12 teams, notably ones that have not been historically above average basketball teams. Boise State and Colorado State, welcome to the Big 12. The Big 12 recognizes that they aren’t part of the P3 in football any longer. But they hope to market their league as almost its own environment apart from the P3, with compelling storylines and traditions of its own. 

 <div class="img-row">
  <img src="/AnacondasPics/Big12A.jpg" alt="Big12a" class= "medbig" />
  <img src="/AnacondasPics/Big12B.jpg" alt="Big12b" class= "medbig" />
<div>

The Big 12 will likely still be supplying one of the top ranked conference champions each year, but they will have competition from the other G3 conferences for those autobids. The Big 12 is banking on being able to take advantage of the likely cannibalism that will be present in the more homogenous P3 conferences.  

As for the fallen power teams, they had 3 options: the Pac-12, the American, or the Other 4. Obviously, the O4 was basically not an option for any of these teams, as their media deals are a pittance compared to what these teams are used to. That left the American or the Pac-12. But the Pac 12 identified this as an opportunity to boost themselves, as they had been floundering as a conference since the latest round of realignment. Choosing to focus on basketball rather than football, the Pac-12 extended invitations to the best basketball programs that were ousted by the P3. The Pac-12 will still compete for one of those autobids, but are unlikely to supply a second CFP team anytime soon. However, don’t be surprised if this iteration of the Pac 12 sends 3/4 of their entire conference every year to March Madness. 

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/ConfPac12.jpeg" alt="SEC Conference" class= "med" />

As for the final G3 conference, the American simply picked up the pieces that the Pac-12 left for them. A hodge podge of old over achieving G5 teams and underachieving P4 teams, this American conference has a murky future. As far as this reporter is concerned, this conference is second only to the Big 12 as the most fascinating conference to monitor in the years going forward.

 <img src="/AnacondasPics/ConfAmerican.jpeg" alt="SEC Conference" class= "med" />

### TV deal meddling

What may come as a surprise to many is the scheduling agreement brokered by ESPN and the new media power house Barstool Sports with the new Power 3 conferences. Each power conference will play only 6 conference games, with the other 6 games consisting of 2 against each of the other power conferences, and 2 against other cupcake schools. Interestingly, part of the agreement was that the Power 3 was forbidden from playing the Big 12, PAC-12, or the American for any of their cupcake games. The only way for a P3 to play a non P3 team was through a matchup in the playoff. 

Speaking of the playoff, part of the 2029 Supreme Court decision was to freeze the playoff structure as it was in perpetuity. Meaning it would stay 12 teams, with autobids to the 5 highest ranked conference champions forever or until the government intervenes. Time will tell if the P3 consolidation to corner the high star recruiting market will pay off. Perhaps it will simply cause too much cannibalism in the conferences, hurting their playoff representation. How will the voters treat the Big 12? Will the new G3 get more or less respect than the old G5? Will a O4 team ever breakthrough to the playoff? Only time will tell, but conference realignment is likely done for the next 10 years or better with the media deals firmly in place. 

### Anacondas Update
This article will be updated as soon as the story of the Anacondas unfolds.

## Will the Jazz Ace the 2025 Draft or Fear the Future?

NBA Champion - the coveted title every team longs for. The cumulative sum of countless
years spent building the right culture, assembling an elite roster, and overcoming adversity. Any
team ever crowned NBA Champion has embodied discipline, consistency, and resolve. Perhaps
even a bit of luck at times. Though each and every one of these teams had to build a
championship team from something less than that. So how did they do it? Many have tried and
only few have succeeded. This season marked the 76th NBA championship. Of the 30 current
NBA franchises, 10 have never won an NBA title… including the Utah Jazz.

Historically known as one of the winningest regular season teams in NBA history since
the franchise’s conception in 1974, the Utah Jazz have developed an overall identity of regular
season success and postseasons that time after time have come up short. A culture of winning - but
not winning in the most crucial moments - has left fans both disappointed and hungry for more.
Yet, since the trades of Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and others from the 2022 postseason, the
Jazz have fallen into their first real rebuilding stage since the early to mid 2000s. After two
consecutive underwhelming offseason moves by the Jazz, another draft has arrived, and along
with it, another chance for the Jazz to acquire new, young talent that could help jumpstart their
resurgence into playoff and championship contention.

After finishing the 2024-25 season with the worst regular season record and the top
lottery odds for a top 4 pick, the Jazz fell to 5, virtually eliminating any chance of drafting the
consensus number 1 pick, Cooper Flagg. The Jazz now look to bounce back from this
disappointing draw and make the most of their position in this draft. The question is, what should
they do? With a mixed roster of young, raw talent and seasoned veterans, the Jazz front office
has multiple directions they could take the team this offseason. As the roster currently stands,
Lauri Markkanen is the clear centerpiece, though if the Jazz intend to build a contending team,
they may need to look to part with some of their younger players and draft capital in order to
acquire another star-level player. If the Jazz want to do more than just make noise in the
regular season and first round of the playoffs, that star will need to be an even better player than
Markkanen. Though he is an all-star level player, Markkanen does not possess the ball dominant
style of play and ability to create his own shot at will that a team requires in its championship-
level superstar. The new reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder have two such players in
their MVP - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - as well as their first time all-star - Jalen Williams - who
is only continuing to improve as time goes on. This dynamic one-two punch, surrounded by a
supporting cast of elite shooters and defensive juggernauts is what led to the Thunder winning
this year’s NBA Finals. The Jazz have already begun building a promising young team with a
strong frontcourt defense in the likes of Walker Kessler and Taylor Hendricks, but the lack of
elite perimeter defense is one of the biggest holes in the Jazz roster, and has been for years. With
the 2025 NBA draft taking place June 25 the Jazz need to prioritize these two types of players:

1. A ball dominant player who can play off the dribble, get to his spots with ease, create
his own shots - and knock them down - at will, and finish at the basket at a high rate;

2. A strong, defensive minded player who plays with unrelenting intensity and defensive
discipline. A player who can get the crowd involved by his hustle plays, defensive stops,
and impact on both ends of the floor;

These types of players can be hard to come by, particularly outside the top few picks of a draft.
With the Jazz positioned at the 5th pick, they must discern whether any of the players available
could be that player. The majority of mock drafts have the top two picks locked down as Cooper
Flagg (1) and Dylan Harper (2). After that, it all appears to be a little more up in the air. VJ
Edgecomb has emerged as the most likely pick at number 3. Though rumors abound that several
teams may either be trying to trade up or trade back within the top 10. It’s possible that VJ
Edgecomb could fall to the Jazz at 5, but it does not seem likely. Edgecomb is the type of
ferocious, unwavering, and extremely athletic perimeter defender that the Jazz desperately need.
Add to that his smooth three-point shot and potential for offensive growth and he could be an
elite two-way guard for years to come. If the Jazz are set on Edgecomb, they may need to make a
move to trade up in the draft. Reports have indicated that the Jazz and the Sixers may be in talks
around a trade involving the number 3 pick. Whether the Jazz choose to trade up, stay at 5, or
even trade back, these are the players who they are likely considering drafting:

- VJ Edgecomb: Likely only available if the Jazz move up to the 3rd pick.
- Jeremiah Fears: Smaller point guard who the Jazz have worked out and reportedly are
very high on. Very quick and good primary ball handler, but his three point shot and
finishing at the rim needs work. He has recently moved up the board in many mock drafts
as a potential suitor for the Jazz. Though, this would create a log jam at the guard
position with Isaiah Collier, Keyonte George, and Collin Sexton.
- Tre Johnson: Elite scorer who can get to his spots, knock down outside shots, and go on
huge scoring spurts. His inability to get to the rim at a strong rate and his lack of defensive
upside are his primary weaknesses.
- Kon Knueppel: An overall solid guard with decent size but average athleticism. Great
three-level scorer who can control the ball and also facilitate decently well. Defensive is a
bit of a question mark as he was rarely tasked to guard opposing teams’ best players in
college but his overall defensive capabilties seem sufficient with room for improvement.
- Ace Bailey: The biggest boom or bust option for the Jazz. Touted as a top 2 or 3 pick for
the majority of the past year, he has recently fallen on draft boards due to not holding a
single workout with any team and his team specifically saying he does not want to be
drafted by certain teams, including the Jazz. He has good size at nearly 6’8” without
shoes and has a smooth shooting stroke, but there are questions about his shot-creating
ability, offensive consistency, and maturity.
- Khaman Maluach: More of a stretch for the number 5 pick, but there have been on and
off rumors about teams being interested in Walker Kessler. However, most recent reports
say that Kessler is not available. This pick is likely only considered if the Jazz move on
from Kessler and his big contract extension this season.

Edgecomb seems to be the best overall fit for what the Jazz need and are trying to do with the
team moving forward. He will likely be a defensive force in the league for years to come and
may end up surprising people with how good his offense is. This is exactly the kind of
expectation Donovan Mitchell had coming into the league, but Edgecomb is a much better
defender than Mitchell.
Johnson and Knueppel are both strong offensive picks with Johnson perhaps having a slightly
higher ceiling and lower floor, while Knueppel is a safe pick and a player who will be a solid
piece on any roster for many years.
Fears could end up being a very good player, but he simply does not fit into the current Jazz
roster. Collier emerged last season as a reliable facilitating point guard with flashes of star
potential. It would be difficult to get all the Jazz guards minutes with Fears added to the roster
and the Jazz likely do not want to move on from Collier so quickly. Could the Jazz’ reported
interest in Fears simply be a strategic cover up to try and get other teams interested in Fears, like
the Wizards, Pelicans, or Nets to trade up?
Ace Bailey is perhaps one of the biggest stories in this draft. He could go as high as 3 or as low
as 6, 7, or 8. His camp has made it clear that they don’t want him in Utah, even though his
positional fit in Utah would be great, as small forward is a position that the Jazz are
lacking in depth. If he turns out to be a star player, he could become a corner piece for the Jazz
for many years to come. But could his reluctance to play in Utah end up driving him out in a few
years just like Donovan Mitchell? The Jazz front office must determine whether the high risk of
this pick is worth the potential reward.

So what should the Jazz do? In a year of what could make or break the immediate future of the
team, there seems to be a lot at stake. Should the Jazz make a move for a big star to place
alongside Lauri Markkanen and push for the postseason this year? This would result in them
losing their 2026 1st round pick to the Thunder, but acquiring the right player could propel the
Jazz back into contention. Do they double down on the rebuild and look to continue developing
their young players? With the recent hiring of Austin Ainge as the new team president, Ainge
made it clear that the team will not be actively trying to tank in the coming season. This could
mean that we see more from the veteran players this year than we did last year, but the team will
still want to prioritize its younger players' development as well. Whatever happens, this offseason will be a telling time that dictates the trajectory of the Jazz for next season and years to come, and it all
starts tonight.

With the 5th pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, the Utah Jazz select…

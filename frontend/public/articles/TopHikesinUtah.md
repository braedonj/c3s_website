# Scenic Hikes Worth Doing
## Outside the National Parks
Avoid the crowds, and the fees (at least less fees) with these lesser known, but still popular adventures. Categorized by length.
### Longer Hikes
1. First up is Buckskin Gulch. This hike is about an hour away from Kanab, Utah. To arrive will require driving east from Kanab and then turning south onto a less developed road heading south. Two roads, and main trailheads exist, depending on the route you want to take. Wire Pass to the west and White House Campground due north of the gulch. It is 21 miles one way, so a shuttle from one trailhead to the other poses as the best option. This trail can be accomplished as a one day hike or a backpacking experience. Unfortunately, to camp in the canyon requires a permit and regulation requires that you pack out your poop. Nice. To experience the canyons just for a day, also requires a small probably $6 fee. Limited to no water here, so packing water is a necessity. Also, this is a slot canyon, so obviously pay attention to weather and use caution. 30 feet of rope could prove beneficial.
If starting at Wire Pass trailhead, head down the wash as the walls eventually converge. Continue down the canyon until hitting the confluence with the Paria River. This could be a good stop to camp for the night. At the confluence, turn right and head north up the canyon. Eventually hitting White House trailhead after about 8 miles. 
This is the longest and deepest slot canyon in the US, so it solicits solitude but also beauty. A day hike, starting at Wire Pass and back could be a good option for a limited time and trail. It is about 9 miles total if going to the Paria confluence and back.

2. Coyote Gulch. One of the most gorgeous hikes around. It is found close to the town of Escalante, driving on the bumpy hole-in-the-rock road. Follow it until reaching the trailhead, various trailhead options exist. Starting at the initial trailheads, the first part of the hike is exposed to the heat for 6 miles, and then enters a short slot canyon. This is where the fun begins. Secondary trailheads require short sun exposure and then a steep hike/ down-climb into the canyon. This is recommended as the distance to the Gulch is much shorter.  A deep canyon surrounds a perennial stream, so this hike is most enjoyable when the stream runs most. Twists and turns and arches abound. One bridge Jacob Hamblin arch showcases the stream running through it. Trail lengths vary depending on distance traveled and the chosen trailhead. The longest distances are 14 miles one way, for a total of 28 miles. However, the closest trailhead might last 12 miles total (to the Escalante River and back). It is optional and fine to turn around any time, as the initial drop and upcanyon and then downcanyon hiking will capture many beautiful elements of the hike.
3. Boulder Mountain. This is a hike that can take as long as you want it. With hikes to lakes and overlooks, this plateau has it all. The area is also an excellent place to camp and has great fishing. The itinerary is up to your discretion and how far your car can make it. The plateau sits closest to Bicknell, Utah and views of Capital Reef can be seen on its East end. It is beautiful all around. It is classified as the highest timbered plateau in North America. ![Boulder Mountain](https://wildlandtrekking.com/content/uploads/2021/04/image-boulder-mountain11.jpg)
4. The Utah classic. Mount Timpangos. This trail climbs to the second highest mountain in the Wasatch range, with the best views. Two trailheads exist: Aspen Grove and Timponkee. Each takes about 16 to 14 miles respectively. Plan accordingly as the base trailhead can be hot, but up on the top of the peak, it grows cold and sometimes windy. Trails follow windy switchbacks following a cold stream. Eventually the trail crests to a mountain plain, and continues to the Saddle. Upon this point, there is lots of exposure and winds, and not easy for those scared of heights. The trail culminates into the climax of the mountain where a metal shack exists. This route is very popular and you are guaranteed to see people there, and everywhere. At the top, 360 degree views abound to showcase the beauty of Utah Valley, Salt Lake Valley, Heber Valley, and more.
5. Red Pine Lake. This is found up Little Cottonwood Canyon and is about 7.5 miles in length, so a moderate length that includes a substantial elevation gain. The trail takes the hiker to alpine lakes and forests and along the way is Gloria Falls.

### Shorter Hikes
6. On the theme of Mt. Timpanogos, climbing to Timpanogos Cave is a fun experience for the young and maybe the old. It's about a three mile round trip hike, following a paved path to a cave. Tour guides are required and must be paid for and booked beforehand. It is a national monument after all.

7. Stewart Falls. This is a short hike to a waterfall on the backside of Mt. Timpangos. 4 miles in length and very popular because of its accessibility.

8. Lower Calf Creek Falls. A popular hike found near Escalante. At the trailhead, follow the trail up the canyon until reaching the falls. It is possible to swim near the falls, but do not get too close to the water fall.

## National Park Hikes
Many hikes exist in the parks that are spectacular. I will include two here, out of many. One is shorter and one is longer.

9. Fiery Furnace in Arches National Park. This, in addition to the National Park entrance fee, requires a permit that is tough to acquire. Drive to the trailhead at the northern portion of the park. It is permissible to explore wherever, as long as following leave no trace practices; however, the main trail is a loop. Follow it counter clockwise and follow the arrows, they can be sometimes hard to follow. There are short side trails along the way, and each one is worth it, with additional views of deep canyons and arches. The hike is condensed, but very much worth it. It is something to be witnessed, as pictures do not capture the full experince of the trail. ![Fiery Furnace](https://www.hikingwalking.com/files/US/UT/fiery_furnace/lrg_ut_P1270003.jpg)

10. Chesler Park Loop. This is found at Canyonlands National Park in the Needles district. The trailhead might be about an hour and a half away from Moab. The trail heads in the direction of the Colorado River, bringing the hiker to the Chesler Park viewpoint. This is where the loop commences. Follow it down to see the twists, turns, canyons, needles, and everything that the area has to offer. The total length of the hike and loop is about 10.7 miles.

# Historical Pace for the Rockies

This will be updated weekly. But current record stands at 15-57. That is on pace for 42 wins.

Worst record in modern era, playing 162 games: 2024 Chicago White Socks with a record of 41-121.

They Rockies are bad (very bad), but looks like they are making some ground on the White Sox to perhaps finish ahead of them.

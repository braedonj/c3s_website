# Lets Improve the Broken System

College Football is broken. As a rabid fan of the game I love, I can tell you that the
system is flawed. Rewards are given based on past achievements and current prestige far more
than from actual on-field success. This is wrong. The players deserve better. I think there is a
solution. A solution to mend the gap between traditional powerhouse schools and their smaller
counterparts. A solution to bring college football to its true potential as the dominant sport in
America. A solution that might even rival the magic of march madness. However, before you can
understand the solution, I need to give you a crash course on college football history, the growth
it has made to this point, and how that impacts the argument on both sides.

The national champion in College Football has changed how it is determined over the years. When the sport was first gaining popularity, the media oversaw the “ranking” of each team in the nation, prior to each week’s round of games. So naturally, at the end of the season the team ranked #1 was awarded the title of national champion. No game against a worthy foe was required of them. They simply needed to pass the medias “eye test” and be crowned champions.

Its easy to see the flaws in such a system. Then the game evolved. The Bowl Championship
Series was introduced. The BCS was good because it introduced a national title game but was
also controversial because it introduced “automatic qualifiers”. These automatic qualifiers were
some really complicated legal speak, but essentially what they meant was if a team wins the
regular season conference championship of one of the “power 5" conferences (SEC, PAC-10,
BIG 10, BIG 12, ACC) they gained an automatic bid to a BCS bowl game, which was less
prestigious than the national championship game, but still resulted in recognition of achievement
for the school. So, conference alignment was far more important to “success” than was winning.
But due to the outcry resulting from too many non-BCS conference teams going undefeated in
their regular seasons and still not being invited to a BCS bowl game, the BCS was “disbanded”
in place of the current college football playoff system. The thing is though, the disbanding was
more of a relabeling, since the same people that ran the BCS are the people that decide who gets
to play in the playoff. So soon after, there were 4 teams that were considered for a chance to play for the national championship, rather than 2. Still determined by inevitably biased individuals. Still
influenced more by conference alignment than actual success. That is close to where we are at right now.
As you can see, the game has gone through many changes in that span, and it’s time for the game
to evolve once more. The solution is simple; we must expand.

I propose that we move the evolution of college football forward towards it ultimate
destiny through the expansion of the current college football playoff system from a 12-team model
to a 16-team model. Many of the analysts and media members who care for fair competition and
recognize the injustice to small schools were currently pushing for the expansion to an 8-team
playoff. While that would be progress, great progress even, the 16-team model is more effective
in accomplishing the end goal; fairness. We must remember that the reason for this call to
expansion is because of the small school injustice. If that is truly our aim, not just for more
money, but for the sake of competition, the sake of fairness, then the 16-team route would be far
more effective.
To put this injustice in a real-world perspective, every year, before the first snap of the
season, about half of division 1 football teams are eliminated from a chance to win a national
championship. Before the first snap! It doesn’t matter if these teams don’t lose a single game all
year, they will not have a chance to play for a national title. Take the recent 2017 UCF
Black Knights for example, since they were especially ***shafted*** by the current system. They were not a
part of the “group of 5” conferences, which just means they don’t belong to the former BCS
regime. They went undefeated throughout the regular season, including 3 wins against in
conference foes that were ranked in the top 25 by the playoff committee. There were granted a
New Year’s 6 bowl berth, which is basically a consolation prize for all the teams that were
“deserving” but ultimately excluded from the 4 potential champions due to the biases of the men
in charge. In their New Years 6 bowl they faced the Auburn tigers. This Auburn team had
defeated both Georgia and Alabama during the regular season, the same Georgia and Alabama
that played in the national championship game! UCF defeated them in a game that wasn’t as
close as the final score might indicate. UCF went undefeated the whole year, they beat the only
team that beat the “national champions” and the national runner-up’s, and yet they don’t get to
be crowned national champions? Or even play for a chance to be national champions? There is
something wrong with that. The sad part is that this is only one example of a many to choose
from of small schools being bullied by the oppressive postseason regulations.

Detractors to a 16-team playoff would cite players health as the biggest reason to avoid it.
They would say that 3 extra games being imposed on the already oppressed college football
players would be unethical. That is totally fair. I even agree with that. The easy rebuttal is to
remove all nonconference games from the regular season entirely, making the regular season 9
total games, with a potential 4 more games during tournament play. The current system has 12
total regular season games, possible conference championship game, and potential 3 more tournament games. If you did your math right, that is 1 less game for the downtrodden football players. Furthermore, the exclusion of nonconference games eliminates the strength of schedule nonsense that has become one of the
fixtures of sports analysts and X (twitter) pundits when determining who is most “deserving” to be a
contender in the playoff, and then completely ignored by the committee (because the power 5
schedules small teams for their nonconference all the time).

The problem is an epidemic. There have been 6+ undefeated teams since 2004 that never
had a chance to play for the national championship. Today, half of the teams are eliminated from
national contention before the first snap, even "power-house" Florida State. Being part of a certain conference has more weight than winning games. These major issues need to be addressed and rectified. Expansion of the college football playoff is the only way to rectify them. Expansion is the only way that that fairness will reign. Expansion is the only way for college football to realize its true potential.

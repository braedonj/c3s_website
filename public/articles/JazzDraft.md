# Jazz are struggling

The Jazz needed lottery luck, but alas nothing. After a year of tanking, the odds were in the favor of the Jazz, Wizards, and Hornets to acquire the top picks in the draft. In an unexpected and devastating outcome, the Jazz are placed in the 5th draft position. Well outside Cooper Flagg potential, and outside of the top 4 predicted prospects. After the initial four, there is a hodgepodge of similarly rated players. This equivalence dillutes the top 5 pick to equally valuable as the top ten pick, reducing the trade value of the Jazz's first round pick. So after this utter disappointment what do the Jazz do from here? There are three following proposals:

## Continue to Tank
To continue the direction of the past three seasons would be nothing new; although Jazz nation is starting to lose patience in trusting this process, especially after the results of the lottery. Tanking is not a real guarantee of a top three pick, let alone top one, as the Jazz would have had if the draft followed the rules of the NFL. The lottery system has failed, ever since the rules change to prevent tanking, of promoting the worst team by record to the first draft position. This is a discussion for another day. Overall, it is difficult to embrace tanking as fully when there is actually a greater chance of acquiring the 5th pick (48%), then any of the top four picks.

### Continue to Tank- Trade Down

### Continue to Tank- Remain
